# In this SQL, I answered multiple questions relating to customer sales, tracking sales as they related to sales agents, and other questions to quantify the data set.

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT firstname,
       lastname,
       customerID,
       country
  FROM customers
 WHERE country != 'USA';

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
  FROM customers
 WHERE country = 'Brazil';

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT firstname || ' ' || lastname AS [Full Name],
       invoiceid,
       invoicedate,
       billingcountry
  FROM customers
       LEFT JOIN
       invoices ON customers.customerid = invoices.customerid
 WHERE billingcountry = 'Brazil'
 ORDER BY lastname;

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT firstname || ' ' || lastname AS [Full Name],
       Title
  FROM employees
 WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
 ORDER BY lastname;

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
  FROM invoices
 ORDER BY billingcountry ASC;

6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT invoiceid,
       customers.firstname || ' ' || customers.lastname AS [Customer Name],
       employees.firstname || ' ' || employees.lastname AS [Support Sales Agent]
  FROM customers
       JOIN
       invoices ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.customerid
       JOIN
       employees ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT invoiceid AS [Invoice ID],
       customers.firstname || ' ' || customers.lastname AS [Customer Name],
       customers.country AS [Customer Country],
       employees.firstname || ' ' || employees.lastname AS [Support Sales Agent],
       invoices.total AS [Invoice Total]
  FROM customers
       JOIN
       invoices ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.customerid
       JOIN
       employees ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT count( * ) 
  FROM invoices
 WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%';

9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT count( * ) 
  FROM invoice_items;
  
10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.

SELECT invoiceid,
       trackid,
       tracks.name,
       unitprice,
       quantity
  FROM invoice_items
       LEFT JOIN
       tracks ON invoice_items.trackid = tracks.trackid;
       
11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item.

SELECT invoiceid,
       trackid,
       artists.name AS [Artist Name],
       tracks.name AS [Track Name],
       unitprice,
       quantity
  FROM invoice_items
       JOIN
       tracks ON invoice_items.trackid = tracks.trackid
       JOIN
       albums ON tracks.albumid = albums.albumid
       JOIN
       artists ON artists.ArtistId = albums.AlbumId;

12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT tracks.name AS [Track Name],
       albums.Title AS [Album Name],
       media_types.name AS [Media Type],
       genres.name AS Genre
  FROM tracks
       JOIN
       genres ON tracks.genreid = genres.genreid
       JOIN
       albums ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.albumid
       JOIN
       media_types ON tracks.MediaTypeId = media_types.MediaTypeID;

13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT employees.firstname || ' ' || employees.lastname AS [Support Sales Agent],
       count(customers.supportrepid) AS [Sales per Agent]
  FROM customers
       JOIN
       invoices ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.customerid
       JOIN
       employees ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
 GROUP BY employees.firstname;
 
14. Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009?

SELECT employees.firstname || ' ' || employees.lastname AS [Support Sales Agent],
       count(invoices.invoicedate) AS [Sales in 2009]
  FROM customers
       JOIN
       invoices ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.customerid
       JOIN
       employees ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
 WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'
 GROUP BY employees.firstname;
